# Chess-Using-C
This project basically focus on usage of data structures to implement the chess game. The basic a idea comes from a algorithm called min max algorithm in game theory. To implement min max algorithm directed graph is used which helps easy solving of min max algorithm with efficient memory usage.
For GUI openGl has been used which is easily approachable.
This project uses only two level analysis and uses linear mathematical function for calculation which can replaced with more accurate exponential functions.
